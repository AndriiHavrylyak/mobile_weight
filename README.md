# mobile_weight

Application for non-operator weighing of cars (trucks)

## Getting Started

After the car travels on the weight, the driver scans the qr code. Then the application displays the weight from the weight in real time (using sockets). After the weight has stabilized, the weigh button appears. The driver presses a button with a weigh in app and the weight is recorded in the TTN.
